This repository servers as a demonstrator for selenium. It does so by providing some examples to scrape Twitter.
At the moment, there is a functional feed scraper which scrapes the user's timeline. It collects basic information on the tweets that appear on one's timeline. More specifically this includes:
- Account name of sender of tweet
- Datetime information
- Tweet text
- Hyperlink to the individual tweet.
